The Kiva system uses movable storage shelves that can be lifted by small, autonomous robots. By bringing the product to the worker, productivity is increased by a factor of two or more, while simultaneously improving accountability and flexibility. A Kiva installation for a large distribution center may require 500 or more vehicles. As such, the Kiva system represents the first commercially available, large-scale autonomous robot system. The first permanent installation of a Kiva system was deployed in the summer of 2006.}, number={1}, journal={AI Magazine}, author={Wurman, Peter R. and D’Andrea, Raffaello and Mountz, Mick}, year={2008}, month={Mar.}, pages={9} }

The throughput of such centers is largely determined by the total idle time of all stations since their queues can frequently become empty. To address this problem, we first formalize and study the one-shot version that assigns stations to a set of agents and finds collision-free paths for the agents to their assigned stations. We present efficient algorithms for this task based on a novel min-cost max-flow formulation that minimizes the total idle time of all stations in a fixed time window. We then demonstrate how our algorithms for solving the one-shot problem can be applied to solving the lifelong problem as well. Experimentally, we believe to be the first researchers to consider real-world automated sortation centers using an industrial simulator with realistic data and a kinodynamic model of real robots. On this simulator, we showcase the benefits of our algorithms by demonstrating their efficiency and effectiveness for up to 350 agents.&lt;/p&gt;}, number={06}, journal={Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence}, author={Kou, Ngai Meng and Peng, Cheng and Ma, Hang and Kumar, T.

abstract = {The multi-agent path-finding (MAPF) problem has recently received a lot of attention. However, it does not capture important characteristics of many real-world domains, such as automated warehouses, where agents are constantly engaged with new tasks. In this paper, we therefore study a lifelong version of the MAPF problem, called the multi-agent pickup and delivery (MAPD) problem. In the MAPD problem, agents have to attend to a stream of delivery tasks in an online setting. One agent has to be assigned to each delivery task. This agent has to first move to a given pickup location and then to a given delivery location while avoiding collisions with other agents. We present two decoupled MAPD algorithms, Token Passing (TP) and Token Passing with Task Swaps (TPTS). Theoretically, we show that they solve all well-formed MAPD instances, a realistic subclass of MAPD instances. Experimentally, we compare them against a centralized strawman MAPD algorithm without this guarantee in a simulated warehouse system. TP can easily be extended to a fully distributed MAPD algorithm and is the best choice when real-time computation is of primary concern since it remains efficient for MAPD instances with hundreds of agents and tasks. TPTS requires limited communication among agents and balances well between TP and the centralized MAPD algorithm.},

abstract = {Path finding for autonomous agents has been traditionally driven by finding optimal paths, typically by using A* search or any of its variants. When it comes to simulating virtual humanoids, traditional approaches rarely consider aspects of human memory or orientation. In this work, we propose a new path finding algorithm, inspired by current research regarding how the brain learns and builds cognitive maps. Our method represents the space as a hexagonal grid with counters, based on brain research that has investigated how memory cells are fired. Our path finder then combines a method for exploring unknown environments while building such a cognitive map, with an A* search using a modified heuristic that takes into account the cognitive map. The resulting paths show how as the agent learns the environment, the paths become shorter and more consistent with the optimal A* search. Moreover, we run a perceptual study to demonstrate that the viewers could successfully identify the intended level of knowledge of the simulated agents. This line of research could enhance the believability of autonomous agents’ path finding in video games and other VR applications.}
