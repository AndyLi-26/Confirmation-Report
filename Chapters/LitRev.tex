\section{Overview of Practical Limitation of Optimal MAPF}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item speed(performance)  $\rightarrow$ sub-optimal solvers
    \item robots operates in continuous environment $\rightarrow MAPF_R$
    \item robots runing with multiple constraints, such as battery $\rightarrow$ multi-objective MAPF
    \item in warehouse, robots continue working after arrived its initial goal location, because there are more ordering, $\rightarrow$ Life long MAPF
    \item in warehouse, human and robot need to interact in a space-constraint place. 
\end{enumerate}
