\chapter{Introduction}
Multi-Agent PathFinding(MAPF) is a problem which computes feasible plans for many agents cooperatively.
MAPF has been popular in the research community for many decades due to its wide variaty of applications, including automated warehouse\cite{warehouse1_2008,warehouse2_2020,warehouse3_2017}, Robot Coordination\cite{robot_2016}, multi-drone coordination\cite{drone_2022}, Video Games\cite{vidGame_2022} and robot arm motion planning \cite{motion_planning_2021}.
However, the way classical MAPF problem was defined is too abstract to be able to catch any practical nuances.  
%\section{Research Problem}

\section{Research Objective}
The over-arching research objective for this PhD program is to extend the classical abstract MAPF problem model to capture practical considerations. 
The first one is to considerating continuous time execution.
